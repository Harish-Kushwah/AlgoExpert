Welcome to **AlgoExpert**, a visualization platform designed to help users understand and explore algorithms with interactive visuals. This tool provides users with step-by-step animations and explanations to enhance algorithmic learning.

[Visit AlgoExpert](https://harish-kushwah.github.io/AlgoExpert/)

## Features

- **Interactive Algorithm Visualization**: Choose from a range of algorithms and watch them execute in real time.
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Each algorithm includes concise explanations for each step, aiding in comprehension.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The layout is optimized for an engaging and intuitive experience.
- **PDF Generation**: Generate PDF documents of the algorithm visualization for Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort with inputs of up to 10 numbers, allowing you to save and review visualizations offline.
- **Visualization History**: Store previous visualizations in your browserâ€™s local storage to review them later and track your learning progress.

## Algorithms Covered

The following algorithms are included in the visualization tool:

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Counting Sort**
2. **Radix Sort**
3. **Bucket Sort**

These algorithms provide an interactive visualization experience and support PDF export functionality for inputs up to 10 numbers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern web browser to view and interact with the site seamlessly.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the [AlgoExpert Visualization Tool](https://harish-kushwah.github.io/AlgoExpert/) and goto playground.
2. Select one of the supported algorithms (Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or Bucket Sort).
3. Enter your input numbers and begin the visualization.
4. The **Visualization PDF** is automatically generated if total numbers is less than 10.
5. Visualizations are stored in local storage, so you can view and revisit previous visualizations at any time.

## Future Enhancements
Planned updates to make the platform more comprehensive:
- Adding additional algorithms across various categories.
- Improving customization options for visualization parameters.
- Expanding explanatory content to enhance understanding.
